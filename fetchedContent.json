      "content": "Approaching Physical Brand Experiences and Market Entry Litmus Tests\n====================================================================\n\n‍\n\nWhen introducing a brand to a new market, particularly through physical experiences, it's crucial to balance cultural relevance with brand authenticity. At Selfhood, we ensure that each pop-up or brand activation is not just a litmus test for market entry but also a memorable experience that deeply resonates with the target audience, with a strong emphasis on cultural integration. In these case studies, our focus lies on music-core brands and the various ways this can be manifested as immersive experiences.\n\n‍\n\n!\n\n‍\n\nGolf Wang Pop-up: 10-Year Anniversary\n=====================================\n\n‍\n\nIn celebration of Golf Wang's 10-year anniversary, Selfhood partnered with the brand to orchestrate a month-long pop-up in Seoul, alongside fifteen simultaneous pop-ups across various cities, crystallizing Tyler the Creator's vision for the brand at its peak. This event marked Golf Wang's first official sales channel in Seoul, making it a highly anticipated milestone.\n\n‍\n\nOur approach included comprehensive project management—from importing products into Seoul and selecting the ideal location to setting up the space and managing event staff. Understanding the significance of location, we carefully curated a venue that would attract the right crowd and enhance the overall experience. Selfhood also handled social media content creation, VIP and press invitations, and ensured seamless event production. This pop-up was a crucial market test, assessing Golf Wang's reception in Seoul and laying the groundwork for future expansion.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n!\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nYetiOut x Limited Edt & YetiOut x Kasina: 10-Year Anniversary\n=============================================================\n\n‍\n\nTo commemorate Yeti Out's 10-year anniversary, Selfhood facilitated a collaborative initiative between YetiOut and Tier 0 retailer Limited Edt in Singapore, followed by a similar event in Seoul with Kasina. These events were designed not only to celebrate the milestone but also to introduce YetiOut to new markets through thoughtfully curated physical experiences.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n!\n\n!\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nIn Singapore, Selfhood managed the entire project, from coordinating the collaboration with Limited Edt to overseeing sales and marketing initiatives. The pop-up featured exclusive SMU pieces and culminated in an after-party that generated excitement beyond the retail space.\n\n‍\n\nBuilding on this success, Selfhood brought the same energy to Seoul, utilizing the entire Kasina flagship store—from the ground floor to the rooftop. The Seoul pop-up included exclusive SMU pieces, YetiOut x AIAIAI headphones, a vibrant after-party, and a Korean pocha experience on the rooftop. These events were more than just celebrations; they were strategic litmus tests that provided valuable insights into YetiOut's potential in these key markets."

Through the Jinro Dinner Series, we've crafted intimate dining experiences that bring together diverse communities, celebrating the fusion of heritage and modernity over exceptional food and drink.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n!\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nIISE x Atoboy x Jinro: Jinro Dinner Series\n==========================================\n\n‍\n\nSelfhood conceived, produced, and managed Jinro's collaboration with IISE and Atoboy, the Korean-inspired restaurant by Michelin-starred chef Junghyun Park. This event united the three parties to host an intimate dinner celebrating the fusion of Korean and American cultures through a contemporary lens. Emphasizing their shared Korean heritage within the Asian American experience, the collaborators invited editors, creatives, and tastemakers in New York City to a special one-night-only, 6-course meal at Atoboy, paired with custom Jinro Soju cocktails.\n\n‍\n\nTo elevate the experience, Selfhood worked alongside IISE to design and create a custom-made ceramic soju vessel and shot glass set inspired by Yun Hyong-Keun from the Dansaekwa art movement of the 1970s. The set, presented in a modern reinterpretation of a traditional jewelry box, was hand-built and designed in collaboration with industrial designer Won Seo Choi and gifted to each guest, adding a tactile connection to the evening's theme of heritage and modernity.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nIISE x Soho House x Jinro: Jinro Dinner Series\n==============================================\n\n‍\n\nBuilding on the concept from the Jinro x IISE x Atoboy dinner in New York, Selfhood extended the dialogue to Seoul. Partnering with restaurant MishMash and Soho House, we facilitated another intimate dinner that completed the Seoul-to-New York connection. Leveraging Soho House's community and member outreach, Selfhood engaged Seoul's creatives for this event, which featured modern Korean dishes. The evening concluded with a gathering at a Hanok-style bar, further deepening the cultural exchange between Seoul and New York.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n!\n\n!\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nJinro x Llama San: Jinro Dinner Series\n======================================\n\n‍\n\nFollowing the success of these earlier dinners, Selfhood produced and managed a private dinner with Llama San, a Manhattan restaurant specializing in Nikkei cuisine, which blends Japanese and Peruvian influences. This event celebrated the coming together of New York creatives through Jinro while highlighting the versatility of Jinro Soju in non-traditional Korean settings.\n\n‍\n\nGuests were treated to an exclusive cocktail hour with custom Jinro cocktails, followed by a seated 4-course family-style dinner, with a paired Jinro cocktail for each course. This dinner aimed to showcase Jinro Soju's compatibility with diverse cuisines and cultures. Centered around the theme of gathering before the holiday season, the event featured a curated guest list of 30 local New York creatives from fashion, music, and culture. To capture the essence of the evening, comprehensive photo and video coverage documented the event."

      "content": "Celebrating Heritage and Honoring Tradition: Kith's Dynamic Entry into Seoul\n============================================================================\n\n‍\n\nAs Seoul emerges as one of the world's fastest-growing fashion capitals, we sought to create a launch that would honor both Kith's dynamic NYC roots and Jinro's 100-year heritage. To commemorate the opening of Kith Seoul and Jinro's centennial anniversary, Selfhood facilitated a unique partnership between Kith and Jinro, resulting in Jinro's first-ever co-branded bottle alongside a custom capsule of apparel and accessories. From the outset, Selfhood played a pivotal role in connecting the two brands, guiding the creative process, and overseeing the project through to its highly anticipated launch at Kith's flagship store in Seoul.\n\n‍\n\nThe collaboration between Kith and Jinro aimed to create a bottle design that seamlessly blended the distinct identities of both brands while highlighting the connection between New York and Korea. Selfhood was committed to ensuring that the final design would be a true reflection of this cross-cultural partnership.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n!\n\n!\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nActing as Jinro's agency, Selfhood collaborated closely with Kith on creative direction, marketing strategies, and collaboration management, while simultaneously advising Jinro on how best to convey their rich brand identity and cultural heritage. We developed a comprehensive strategy, timeline, and schedule, clearly defining roles and responsibilities to ensure seamless execution from concept to launch.\n\n‍\n\nWe began with collaborative discussions to ensure that Kith's modern, streetwear-inspired aesthetic could harmonize with Jinro's traditional soju heritage. Key elements from both brands were identified: Kith's minimalist, urban style and Jinro's iconic toad and Chinese character logo, with contemporary twists like creating the first-ever black bottle.\n\n‍\n\nThrough design workshops, we experimented with various concepts. After prototyping and gathering feedback from members in both cities, a final design was selected that elegantly represents the collaboration—a modern black silhouette with the Queens Unisphere as a backdrop to the Jinro toad, and holographic elements in the label. The R&D process for the black bottle was particularly challenging and required extensive trial and error. Achieving the perfect shade and finish while maintaining the bottle's integrity involved numerous iterations, but the result was a flawless design.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n!\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\nThe process for the capsule collection mirrored that of the bottle, with a lot of back and forth to settle on designs that everyone loved and that truly conveyed the essence of the collaboration. The apparel and accessories featured elements representing both New York and Korea, while staying true to the defining features of both Kith (their iconic box logo) and Jinro (the toad). To further honor Korean traditions associated with soju, we also offered soju shot glasses and somaek glasses, rounding out the collection with items that added depth to the experience.\n\n‍\n\nThe full collection is comprised of a manteco wool jacket, fleece hoodies, tees, headwear, and is complemented by a four-pack of shot glasses and a two-pack of somaek glasses, all reflecting the spirit of this unique partnership.\n\n‍\n\n‍\n\n Your browser does not support the video tag."
